# DNS-Resolver
Local Recursive DNS Resolver

My code consists of a DNSResolver class and a DigTest class.

The DNSResolver class implements a simple resolver by using a myDig tool that utilizes recursion to iterate over a query until an A response is received. 

The run the code, simply run the DigTest class. You can test more websites and resolvers by changing the parameters.
Code for testing the websites 10 times each is commented out.
